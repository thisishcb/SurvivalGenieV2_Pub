Survical Genie Version 2 is now available on [https://bhasinlab.bmi.emory.edu/SurvivalGenie2/home](https://bhasinlab.bmi.emory.edu/SurvivalGenie2/home)  
[Survival Genie V1](https://bhasinlab.bmi.emory.edu/SurvivalGenie) is still online.

## ⭐️ Features 
 - 🆕 Pediatric/Adult Case filter
   - You can now select whether to use only Pediatric cases or Adult cases or All cases.
   - Currently, the groups are defined by age cutoff of 20 years old at diagnosis.
 - 🆕 Result Retrieval 
   - You can access previous results with your analysis ID within 24 hours!
 - 🆕 Co-expression Module Analysis
   - Perform the survival analysis based on the High/Low groups partitioned by the GeneSet Variation Score (GSVA) of the module (hub-)genes in a selected dataset (results are calculated per module).
   - you can now input wgcna modules (or any other co-expression networks as long as the column names are compliant, details see [page](https://bhasinlab.bmi.emory.edu/SurvivalGenie2/coexp-module/input)) for Survival Analysis in a selected dataset.
   - ❓Have No Experience in Co-expression Network?
     - if you are using single-cell data: https://smorabit.github.io/hdWGCNA/
     - or use our wrapped function [here](./scripts/get_wgcna_result.R) [hdWGCNA based] - tutorial see [Tutorial](#tutorial)
 - Single Gene Analysis 
   - Perform the survival analysis based on the High/Low groups partitioned by the expression profile of a single gene in supported public datasets.
 - Gene-Ratio Analysis
   - Perform the survival analysis based on the High/Low groups partitioned by the expression ratio of two genes in supported public datasets.
 - Gene-Set Analysis
   - Perform the survival analysis based on the High/Low groups partitioned by the GeneSet Variation Score (GSVA) of the geneset in supported public datasets.
 - Cluster Marker Analysis
   - Perform the survival analysis based on the High/Low groups partitioned by the GeneSet Variation Score (GSVA) of the cluster markers in a selected dataset (results are calculated per cluster).
## Tutorial
 - Tutorial for the website (Explanation of Inputs and Outputs) is available on [SurvivalGenie2 home page](https://bhasinlab.bmi.emory.edu/SurvivalGenie2/home) or check higher resolution [figures](./static/).
